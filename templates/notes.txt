HI Diana-

I’m back in the office and getting back into this. I’m seeing the problem when using our default group of “Research Guides” but not when using a new group called SANDBOX. These two groups use the exact same template code--it just exists in two different files: “DePaul Template” and “TESTING template code.” You can see this in action between this public guide and this test guide. 

Is there anything else we can check to resolve the hidden column problem? I viewed it through the bootstrap overlay extension for Chrome and couldn’t see any issues. I can’t figure out why the same code is giving two different results.

Thank you,
Christine
